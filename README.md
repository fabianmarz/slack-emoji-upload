# Slack Emoji Upload
This puppeteer script automatically adds new Emojis to your Slack team.

On the initial run you have to enter your Slack credentials. The team name is taken from your E-Mail domain. After logging in, a cookie file is stored locally to avoid entering your credentials over and over again.
The script currently processes filesimage files from the invoked folder and try to upload them via the Emoji upload formular. 

## Install
```
$ npm install -g @fabianmarz/slack-emoji-upload
```
or
```
$ yarn add -g @fabianmarz/slack-emoji/upload
```
## Usage
To upload emojis:

```console
$ slack-emoji-upload <path/to/your/emojis>
```

Use `--debug` to show Chromium while running the script:
```console
$ slack-emoji-upload <path/to/your/emojis> [--debug]
```


## Todo
- [ ] Check for cookie expiry.
- [ ] Check if the login was actually successfull.
- [ ] Remove first line of success message.
- [ ] Remove processed file after successfull upload?
- [ ] â€¦
